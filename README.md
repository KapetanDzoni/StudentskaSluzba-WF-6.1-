# StudentskaSluzba-WF-6.1-
Project in C#, simulating interaction between student and students service in Serbian language

My next task was to implement StudentskaSluzba 9 to windows forms. Functionalities are the same aldo, I added fields of study. Based on chosen field student can chose between diferent exams. I also added year of study so students needed to collect required sum of ESPB points to listen to subjects from next year. There was a large learning curve during this project that I encountered with my head first. Especialy with my personality that strives to improve something thats already good enough. This led me to stuff like creating functionality for ListView to preadjust width of column for exam name as it was the longest one so it can show longest exam name without adjustments... Or creating a form that pops up when you whant to change some student data, which on the left shows you only previous data and on the new data so you can easily review and confirm changes... Database containing all listst stayed the same, XML document
